# 🎧 Audio Data Preprocessing with Librosa

> Efficient preprocessing techniques for improved audio analysis and modeling.

---

## 📌 Introduction

Preprocessing is essential in audio-based machine learning tasks. It helps transform raw, noisy audio into structured and analyzable data. This project showcases common preprocessing steps using **Librosa**, a powerful Python library for audio signal analysis.

## 🛠️ Features & Techniques

- 📥 **Importing Libraries**  
  Core Python tools and `librosa` for audio processing.

- 📂 **Loading Audio Files**  
  Convert audio to a 22kHz mono time series for consistency.

- 🌊 **Waveform Visualization**  
  Plot raw audio using `librosa.display.waveshow`.

- 🔍 **Spectrogram Generation**  
  Visualize frequency and amplitude over time using STFT and `specshow()`.

- 🔊 **Feature Extraction**  
  Extract key audio features:
  - **Spectral Centroid** – Indicates brightness of the sound.
  - **Spectral Rolloff** – Frequency where energy drops.
  - **Spectral Bandwidth** – Range of frequencies in the signal.
  - **Zero Crossing Rate** – Signal transition rates.
  - **MFCCs** – Mel-scaled cepstral features.
  - **Chroma Frequencies** – Pitch class profile for musical notes.
